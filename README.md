# Directions
This script will automatically fix DesktopServer version 3.9.3 for macOS Catalina compatibility.

1) [Download this script](https://github.com/ServerPress/catalina-fix/blob/master/catalina-fix-001.scpt?raw=true) and double-click it (to automatically open it in AppleScript editor)
2) Click the triangle "play" button and "OK" to run the script (wait for Terminal to appear)
3) The Terminal window will prompt you for your computer login password to make changes.

Note: your password is hidden, simply type it and press enter in the terminal window.

You may then run DesktopServer. Be sure to use DesktopServer's first option to "Stop or restart..." to ensure all service changes are applied or reboot your system.
